I am willing to observe and think in my free time. I like natural science. Having a certain interest in painting and design, I like draw some pictures, and I also have been in charge of advertising poster design in my junior high school. Reading books is my hobby, especially some domestic and foreign science fiction works. As biology and technology is subjects which I am good at, I participated in the school biology competition class. I will do my best in the wet lab.
